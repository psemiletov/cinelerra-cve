About this branch

This branch is a try to make Cinelerra more stabile - no hangupps
no crashes.

Currently this branch is under development. There is no warranty
that it is usable to create or finish any project. Parts of Cinelerra
may work, parts not.

This branch is developed and tested on Ubuntu 9.04 x86-32.

Main change in this branch is display locking. This change has hopefully 
fixed bugs 278, 383, 406, 414, 493, 519 in bugzilla. The change was 
huge and locking issues are hard to test.

Changes in this branch:
- subtitle decoding in libmpeg3
- added defaults into libmpeg3 for subtitle color
- index generation in libmpeg3
- improved frame accurate seek in libmpeg3
- edit_font_color initialization of S.U.V
- more info in assert info window
- audio streams and vob subtitle tracks are selectable through asset info
- removed BC_Windowevents (now 6 threads less)
- fix of bug 524: 'This is a very standard format mpg 
    that is completely garbled in this player'
- fixed most of GCC4.3.3 warnings
- fixed timebar cursor updating of viewer and compositor
- trace subsystem was rewritten to static buffers, added backtrace
    dump on crash
- composer and viewer always display the frame starting at the time 
    shown on clock. Frame displayed does not depend on
    forward/backward direction.
- goto window honours time format
- lots of cleanups

Known problems (todo list)
- OpenGL output does not work (seems locking related)
- no need to regenerate index when only subtitles are changed
    in asset edit
- time format of goto window changes only after restart of program
- filevorbis is disabled
- cinerella crashes if video4linux2 size is different from 600x800
- remove or move to separate directories unused sources
- implement debugging system
- test on 64bit system

Bug reporting.
I am very interested about reports of crashes and hangs.
To help debug cinelerra, start it from terminal. If cinelerra hangs,
press Ctrl-C. Copy output to mail and send it to cinelerra ml.
It will be fine if you can describe setps to reproduce crash or hang 
of cinelerra.
