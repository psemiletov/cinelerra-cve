About this branch

This branch is a try to make Cinelerra more stabile - no hangupps
no crashes.

Currently this branch is under development. There is no warranty
that it is usable to create or finish any project. Parts of Cinelerra
may work, parts not.

This branch is developed and tested on Ubuntu 10.04 x86-32.

Main change in this branch is display locking. This change has hopefully 
fixed bugs 278, 383, 406, 414, 493, 519 in bugzilla. The change was 
huge and locking issues are hard to test.
Another huge change implementation of pts based timing. This enables
to edit media with variable framerate and get rid of assumption
that audio and video start simultaneously.

Changes in this branch:
- subtitle decoding in libmpeg3
- added defaults into libmpeg3 for subtitle color
- index generation in libmpeg3
- improved frame accurate seek in libmpeg3
- changed size of Preferences window to fit it on 800 px height
- edit_font_color initialization of S.U.V
- more info in assert info window
- audio streams and vob subtitle tracks are selectable through asset info
- removed BC_Windowevents (now 6 threads less)
- fix of bug 524: 'This is a very standard format mpg 
    that is completely garbled in this player'
- fixed most of GCC 4.3.3 warnings
- fixed timebar cursor updating of viewer and compositor
- trace subsystem was rewritten to static buffers, added backtrace
    dump on crash
- composer and viewer always display the frame starting at the time 
    shown on clock. Frame displayed does not depend on
    forward/backward direction.
- goto window honours time format
- lots of cleanups
- OpenGL is enabled while server glx version is >= 1.3
- new one-line internal api for error messages (macros errormsg
    and errorbox)
- cleanup: removed unused sources from cinelerra, guicast, libmpeg3, plugins
- added SOWT audio decoder
- multiline comments of clips and labels are not truncated
- implemented pts based timing on video and audio making possible
    projects without constant framerate
- improved synchronization with Alsa output: no jumping around on playback
- projects created or modified with this branch are incompatible with
    other branches
- removed playback direction dependancy from core rendering
- replaced samplerate based timing with clock based timing
- implemented new API and support macros of all plugins, removed old API
- implemented pts in renderfarm
- created all kind of Null plugins as templates for new plugins
- full rewrite of FileOGG
- removed broken plugins including plugins importing from devices
- all configured ALSA PCM devices are selectable
- some improvements and fixes of the build system
- new plugin C41

Known problems (todo list)
- FileOGG: improve audio/video interleaving
- implement pts in encoders, decoders
- cleanup playback, gui
- new API of plugins and macros need some documentation
- add PCMs to selectable ALSA audio devices, speed up audio start
- handling input devices is buggy (only selected devices may work)
- trimming does not work as described in manual or as expected,
    occasionally crashes
- reel name must be read from project
- crashes if video4linux2 size is different from 600x800
- implement debugging system
- test on 64bit system

Bug reporting.
I am very interested about reports of crashes and hangs.
To help debug cinelerra, start it from terminal. If cinelerra hangs,
press Ctrl-C. Copy output to mail and send it to cinelerra ml.
It will be fine if you can describe setps to reproduce crash or hang 
of cinelerra.
